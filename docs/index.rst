cotat is a visualization tool for the analysis of contact tracing data. Given a
dataframe of people (along with their attributes) and a dataframe of known
contacts among the individuals, cotat exports an interactive HTML visualization
of the network. Furthermore, certain columns of the people dataframe can be
labeled as "membership columns" which allows one to visualize which people
belong to the same groups (e.g. building, club, etc..) even if a contact
between those individuals has not been reported.
