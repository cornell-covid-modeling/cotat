Red nodes are positive cases within the last 2 weeks; they are labeled with
their case number. Furthermore, the opacity of the node decreases as the time
since they tested positive increases, ranging from 1 (today) to 0.5 (2 weeks
ago). All other nodes are blue. Solid edges indicate a contact trace.  Dashed
edges indicate the two nodes are a member of the same group. Use the tabs to
toggle on and off edges by type. Hover over a node for more information. Search
for a case number by typing into the search box above and pressing enter. If
the case is found, it will be enlarged. To reset the search, press the reset
button. Use the toolbar in the top right to navigate the graph. A blue line
indicates the tool is active. Contact Henry Robbins (<a
href="mailto:hwr26@cornell.edu">hwr26</a>) with any questions.
